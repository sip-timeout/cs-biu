This script produces e.mle and q.mle for the usage of a HMMTagger.
the e.mle contains counts needed for tagging while the q.mle contains probabilities calculated using the following lambdas:
for trigrams: 0.64
for bigrams: 0.31
for unigrams: 0.05

the q.mle file also contains triplets of the form
### tag1 tag2 <-> 0.
these are actually all of the pairs we saw together, and this is used for the tagger to perform it's pruning.

for unknown words i used the regexes shown in classes.txt,
the class of a word is the first regex matching it, or none if no match could be found.
the script assumes that the classes.txt file is present on its dir.

the training and model file produces are available here:
